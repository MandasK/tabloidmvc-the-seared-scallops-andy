# Tabloid MVC

Tabloid MVC is a web app for blogging that is based on [Tabloid CLI Proof of Concept](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/TabloidCLI). 

Tabloid MVC has two types of users:

* **Authors** can create Posts, manage their own Posts, and read and comment on other authors' posts.

* **Admins** can do all the things authors can do, but are also in charge of managing all the data in the system.


## Installation

After cloning the repository, build and seed the database by running the SQL queries

01_TabloidMVC_Create_DB.sql

followed by

02_TabloidMVC_Seed_Data.sql

Then launch the project in an IDE such as Visual Studio

## Contributing
The project was initialized by NSS and given to a team including Amanda King, Brendan Abernethy, Erik Lindstrom, and Patrick Murphy.
